## Analytics ‚ú®

_Analytics_ is a tool to measure how people engage with your content so you can improve what isn‚Äôt working, and double down on what is üí™

Add one line of code and Analytics will get to work measuring engagement like, how long did someone spend on the page, how far down did they scroll, and more.

## Features:

### Advanced view counting
    - Analytics does it‚Äôs best to identify unique users so you can better answer questions like ‚ÄúWhat % of users who read this content converted?‚Äù (instead of % of sessions or % of visits, which are different and imho, less tangible).

### Track how much time people spend on the page
    - If people don‚Äôt stick around on your page, they probably aren‚Äôt getting enough value from it. Amazing Analytics can identify this behaviour and highlight where you need to improve.

### Track how far down people scroll on the page (heatmap?)
    - We want to paint a more vivid picture of how people engage with your tutorials, thought-pieces, etc. If someone scrolls to the bottom and they have been on the page for a few minutes, you can be pretty sure they read the whole thing.

### Amazing Analytics score
    - Get an indication for how much people engage with your content at a glance, or sort your content by analytics score.


## Built for marketers and developers

While Analytics can be an‚Ä¶ amazing addition to your marketing stack, it was also built with developers in mind.

If you‚Äôre coding a content platform (like Medium or BlogIn), you can integrate with Analytics to track your users engagement and relay it to them.

1. Embed tracking code.
2. Call REST endpoint, authenticate.
3. Get back beautiful SVG graphs powered by ChartJs or whatever.
